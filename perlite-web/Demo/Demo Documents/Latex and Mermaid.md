Inline math equations go in like so: $\omega = d\phi / dt$. 
Display math should get its own line and be put in in double-dollarsigns:

$$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc.


Consider non-empty sets $A$, $B$ and $C$. Then a binary operation $f$ is a mapping from set $A\times C$ to set $A$ or $B$.
$$f\colon D\subseteq A \times C \to \left[ \begin{array}{lcl} A \\ B \end{array} \right.$$
